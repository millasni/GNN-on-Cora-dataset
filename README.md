# GNN-on-Cora-dataset
A homework on graph neural networks for Deep Learning course at HEC Montreal

This homework consists of two parts: 

* Learning node embeddings and visualizing them with the use of GraphVite package
* Exploring behavior of graph convolutional networks with regard to the number of hidden layers and hidden units per layer (many outputs produced!).

The grade received for this homework was 100/100.
